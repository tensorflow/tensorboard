## Deprecations

TensorBoard features that depend on TensorFlow APIs now require TensorFlow 2.x

supported.

Please note that this does not affect data already written to disk; summaries
emitted by the TF 1.x tf.summary API are still readable and fully supported by
the latest versions of TensorBoard.

Support for Python 3.5 is dropped.

Plugin dashboards have been removed:
- Beholder: see #3843
- Debugger V1: replaced by [Debugger V2][debugger_v2_tutorial]

[debugger_v2_tutorial]: https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/debugger_v2

# Release 2.3.0

## Features

  [tutorial][debugger-v2-tutorial] on how to use the experimental TensorFlow
  APIs to spot NaN's in tensors, view graphs generated from executions, and the
  related lines in the Python source code (#3821)

## TensorBoard.dev updates

- Added support for showing the Distributions tab (#3762)
- Uploader now displays data statistics in the console while uploading data
  (#3678)
- Added new uploader command line flags (#3707)
  - `--dry_run`: causes the uploader to only read the logdir and display
    statistics (if `--verbose` is the default 1) without uploading any data to
    the server
  - `--one_shot`: causes the uploader to exit immediately after all existing
    data in the logdir are uploaded; this mode prints a warning message if the
    logdir doesn't contain any uploadable data
- Upload button in the header offers a convenient, copyable command
- 🧪 **Experimental** DataFrame API: You can now read Scalars data from
  TensorBoard.dev as a Pandas DataFrame (learn more [here][dataframe-tutorial])

removed in a future release; still visible at the `/legacy.html` endpoint)
(#3779). If you observe any bugs that do not reproduce under `/legacy.html`,
please file an issue.

    TensorBoard.dev (#2903)

[TensorBoard.dev]: https://tensorboard.dev/

# Release 2.0.1

## Features

- Preview of TensorBoard.dev uploader! Check out <https://tensorboard.dev/> for
  information and usage instructions.

# Release 2.0.0

The 2.0 minor series tracks TensorFlow 2.0.

## Breaking changes

- TensorBoard now serves on localhost only by default to avoid unintentional
  overexposure. To expose TensorBoard to the network, either use a proxy, bind
  to a specific hostname or IP address by using the `--host` flag, or explicitly
  enable the previous behavior of binding on all network interfaces by passing
  the flag `--bind_all`. See PR #2589.
- The `--logdir` flag no longer supports passing multiple comma-delimited paths,
  which means that it now *supports* paths containing literal comma and colon
  characters, like `./logs/m=10,n=20,lr=0.001` or `./logs/run_12:30:15`. To
  mimic the old behavior, prefer using a tree of symlinks as it works with more
  plugins, but as a fallback the flag `--logdir_spec` exposes the old behavior.
  See PR #2664.
- Projector plugin `visualize_embeddings()` API now takes `logdir` as its first
  parameter rather than `writer` (which only supported TF 1.x summary writers).
  For backwards compatibility TF 1.x writers will still be accepted, but passing
  the logdir explicitly is preferred since it works without any dependency on
  TF 1.x or 2.x summary writing. See PR #2665.
- The namespace `tensorboard.summary.*` now aliases the summary API symbols in
  `tensorboard.summary.v2.*` rather than those in `tensorboard.summary.v1.*`.
  The old symbols can still be accessed under the `.v1` names. Note that the
  new v2 API symbols are exposed in TF 2.0 as the new `tf.summary.*` API and
  this is normally how they should be used. See PR #2670.

## Features

- Smarter log directory polling can be used by passing `--reload_multifile=true`
  to poll all "active" event files in a directory rather than only the last one.
  This avoids problems where data written to the non-last file never appears.
  See PR #1867 for details, including how to adjust the "active" threshold.

- What-If Tool now can sort PD plots by interestingness (#2461)

# Release 1.15.0

The 1.15 minor series tracks TensorFlow 1.15.

  (#2543) - thanks @beasteers
- When recording hyperparameters, the trial ID can now be customized, for easier
  integration with existing tuner systems (#2442)

  - The `TENSORBOARD_BINARY` environment variable can now be set to invoke a
    non-default `tensorboard` binary (#2386)
  - Error messages are now clearer when the TensorBoard binary fails to launch
    (#2395)
  - The `%tensorboard` magic no longer spams log messages when a different
    version of TensorBoard is already running on the same machine (#2470)
  - The `%tensorboard` magic can now be used in Jupyter notebooks running on
    hosts other than `localhost` (#2407)
- What-If Tool improvements:
  - Errors running inference are now surfaced in the What-If Tool UI (#2414)
  - Median error stats are now displayed in addition to mean error stats (#2434)
- Mesh plugin improvements:
  - Now compatible with TensorFlow 2.0 via a new `summary_v2` module (#2443)

- Profile dashboard improvements:
  - Wasted time now appears in the node table, and can be used as a sort key
    (#2525)
  - Memory bandwidth utilization now appears in the dashboard header (#2525)
- Improvements for plugin developers:
  - Plugins can now be rendered in an iframe whose source is served from the
    plugin backend, eliminating the need to bundle a frontend with the
    TensorBoard binary
  - Plugins can now be discovered dynamically and loaded at runtime, by defining
    a `tensorboard_plugins` entry point
  - See our [example dynamically loaded plugin][example-plugin] for a plugin to
    use as a starting point, plus documentation
  - TensorBoard now uses Polymer 2.7 (#2392, et al.)

applied to the old package name (`tensorflow-tensorboard`). To upgrade to
TensorBoard 1.6.0+ we suggest you *first* `pip uninstall tensorflow-tensorboard`
before doing `pip install tensorboard`. See "Known Issues" below if you run into
problems using TensorBoard after upgrading.

- Package `tensorboard` is installed but command and/or module are missing or
  have the wrong version - this may be due to conflicts with other packages that
  provide `tensorboard` scripts or modules. Please uninstall *all* such packages
  including `tensorboard`, `tensorflow-tensorboard` and `tb-nightly` and then
  reinstall `tensorboard`.
