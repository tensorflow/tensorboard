This can be extremely helpful to sample and examine your input data, or to [visualize layer weights](http://cs231n.github.io/understanding-cnn/) and [generated tensors](https://hub.packtpub.com/generative-adversarial-networks-using-keras/). You can also log diagnostic data as images that can be helpful in the course of your model development.\n",
