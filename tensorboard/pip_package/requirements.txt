# Non-vendored runtime dependencies of TensorBoard.

absl-py >= 0.4
# NOTE: this version should be >= the grpc version in our WORKSPACE file.
grpcio >= 1.48.2
markdown >= 2.6.8
numpy >= 1.12.0
# NOTE: The packaging dependency was introduced in order to compare installed
# package versions and conditionally use different supported kwargs
# (specifically the protobuf dependency). If we restrict protobuf >= 5.0.0 we
# can get rid of the packaging dependency.

# 4.24.0 had an issue that broke our tests, so we should avoid that release:
