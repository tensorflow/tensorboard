# Non-vendored runtime dependencies of TensorBoard.

absl-py >= 0.4
# NOTE: this version should be >= the grpc version in our WORKSPACE file.
grpcio >= 1.48.2
google-auth >= 1.6.3, < 3
google-auth-oauthlib >= 0.5, < 1.1
markdown >= 2.6.8
numpy >= 1.12.0
# NOTE: this version must be >= the protoc version in our WORKSPACE file.
# At the same time, any constraints we specify here must allow at least some
# version to be installed that is also compatible with TensorFlow's constraints:
# https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/9d22f4a0a9499c8e10a4312503e63e0da35ccd94/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/setup.py#L100-L107
# We needed to add an upper bound restriction due to issue reported in:
# https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/issues/13485
protobuf >= 3.19.6, < 4.24
requests >= 2.21.0, < 3
setuptools >= 41.0.0  # Note: provides pkg_resources as well as setuptools
# A dependency of our vendored packages. This lower bound has not been correctly
# vetted, but I wanted to be the least restrictive we can, since it's not a new
# requirement, and likely this will not disrupt existing users of the package.
