    /* Legacy mechanism to avoid issues with subpixel anti-aliasing on macOS.
     *
     * In the past [1], macOS subpixel AA caused excessive bolding for light-on-dark text; this rule
     * avoids that by requesting non-subpixel AA always, rather than the default behavior, which is
     * to use subpixel AA when available. The original issue was "fixed" by removing subpixel AA in
     * macOS 14 (Mojave), but for legacy reasons they preserved the bolding effect as an option.
     * Chrome then in turn updated its font rendering to apply that bolding effect [2], which means
     * that even though the `-webkit-font-smoothing` docs [3] suggest that setting `antialiased`
     * would have no effect for recent versions of macOS, it still is needed to avoid the bolding.
