Data loader for tf-graph-dashboard.

The loader loads op graph, conceptual graphs, and RunMetadata associated with an
op graph which is the major difference from the tf-graph-loader which is only
capable of loading an op graph. Another difference is that the loader takes
`selection` from the tf-graph-controls as an input as opposed to URL path of an
data endpoint.
