    The argument list is sorted and may be extended in the future; therefore,
    callers must pass only named arguments to this constructor.

    Args:
      assets_zip_provider: A function that returns a newly opened file handle
          for a zip file containing all static assets. The file names inside the
          zip file are considered absolute paths on the web server. The file
          handle this function returns must be closed. It is assumed that you
          will pass this file handle to zipfile.ZipFile. This zip file should
          also have been created by the tensorboard_zip_file build rule.
      db_connection_provider: Function taking no arguments that returns a
          PEP-249 database Connection object, or None if multiplexer should be
          used instead. The returned value must be closed, and is safe to use in
          a `with` statement. It is also safe to assume that calling this
          function is cheap. The returned connection must only be used by a
          single thread. Things like connection pooling are considered
          implementation details of the provider.
      db_module: A PEP-249 DB Module, e.g. sqlite3. This is useful for accessing
          things like date time constructors. This value will be None if we are
          not in SQL mode and multiplexer should be used instead.
      db_uri: The string db URI TensorBoard was started with. If this is set,
          the logdir should be None.
      logdir: The string logging directory TensorBoard was started with. If this
          is set, the db_uri should be None.
      multiplexer: An EventMultiplexer with underlying TB data. Plugins should
          copy this data over to the database when the db fields are set.
      plugin_name_to_instance: A mapping between plugin name to instance.
          Plugins may use this property to access other plugins. The context
          object is passed to plugins during their construction, so a given
          plugin may be absent from this mapping until it is registered. Plugin
          logic should handle cases in which a plugin is absent from this
          mapping, lest a KeyError is raised.
      window_title: A string specifying the the window title.
