We highly encourage contributions from the community. First, please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

* If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
* If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.
