### Contributor License Agreements

We'd love to accept your patches! Before we can take them, we have to jump a couple of legal hurdles.

Please fill out either the individual or corporate Contributor License Agreement (CLA).

  * If you are an individual writing original source code and you're sure you own the intellectual property, then you'll need to sign an [individual CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).
  * If you work for a company that wants to allow you to contribute your work, then you'll need to sign a [corporate CLA](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html).

Follow either of the two links above to access the appropriate CLA and instructions for how to sign and return it. Once we receive it, we'll be able to accept your pull requests.

***NOTE***: Only original source code from you and other people that have signed the CLA can be accepted into the main repository.

### Working with the team

If you're planning a larger contribution, please get in touch with the team through a GitHub issue before starting work - we can help guide you, and coordinating up front will make the process smoother.

If you want to add a major feature, it may be a good candidate for adding a plugin. Let us know via a GitHub issue, and we can guide you in the process.

### Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose.

### Guidelines for adding a new Feature
If you are adding any new feature or modifying any existing one then please add suitable tests with that, so that we can guide you in the process.
